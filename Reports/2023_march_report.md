## Introduction
During the month of March 2023, I continued my research for my Moonshot Project, there are two ideas that emerged.

First, it’s an idea I already had at the beginning of last year, it’s a cashless payment system, the second idea is a sign language translator.

## Cashless Payment System
The cashless payment system aims to facilitate payments in bars that want to organize parties but do not have enough electronic payment terminal to ensure the cadence, this system could also be used in larger gatherings such as festivals, village parties, association parties, etc...
I intend to use the NFC technology to insure the transactions, for the Debtor side it is necessary a device embarking an NFC tag this one will serve as Wallet, to do it we can use NFC cards, NFC bracelets or some newer phones that are capable of sending and receiving NFC signals.
For the Creditor side I intend to use entry-level phones and recent enough to embed NFC technology, this combine has a fairly powerful and secure application as well as a micro-computer that will serve as a local server will be enough to complete the Cashless system

Implementing a cashless payment system using NFC technology offers benefits such as faster, more secure transactions, and increased convenience. However, challenges include accessibility issues for those without NFC technology and initial setup costs. Despite this, using NFC can improve efficiency and reduce fraud in large gatherings, though resistance from some users is possible. It's important to weigh the potential benefits and challenges before implementing the system to ensure its success.

## Sign Language Translator
The purpose of the sign language translator is to help deaf and mute people to be better understood and to better understand others, this system is intended for professional and personal use.
For the personal rating I imagine an application that will present itself as a video calling application, such as facetime or whatsapp and that will embed an image recognition technology based on artificial intelligence.
For the professional side, I imagine the image recognition technology embedded in a web extension and that would be directly integrated with the most famous video conferencing platforms, such as Zoom, Google Meet and Microsoft Teams.

The sign language translator has the potential to greatly improve communication between deaf or mute individuals and others, both personally and professionally. The use of image recognition technology can enhance the accuracy and speed of the translation process, providing greater convenience and accessibility. However, the system may face challenges in terms of cost, technical requirements, and user adoption. The personal application may be more readily adopted, but the professional extension will need to be seamlessly integrated with existing video conferencing platforms. Additionally, the accuracy and reliability of the translation technology will need to be thoroughly tested and evaluated to ensure its effectiveness.

## Conclusion
In March 2023, I pursued two innovative ideas for my Moonshot project. The first idea is a cash-free payment system using NFC technology for bars, festivals and large gatherings. The second is a sign language translator who uses image recognition technology to help people who are deaf and mute communicate with others. The cash-free payment system is designed to make transactions safer and easier, while the sign language translator will bridge the communication gap between people who speak different languages. Both projects have the potential to have a significant impact on society and I am happy to develop and explore their potential.
