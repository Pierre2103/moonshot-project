Unfortunately, my Moonshot Project has not yet started. During the first oral presentation, it was not accepted. Since that day, I have been actively searching for a Moonshot Project in which I can fully invest myself. Although I was very passionate about my initial project, an artificial intelligence system for creating cinematic drone shots using DJI drones, I have come to realize that there are significant economic and legal obstacles that must be overcome in order to develop this project. Therefore, I have had to consider other options and rethink my approach to finding a suitable project.<br><br>
Despite the setback of my initial project not being accepted, I have not given up on my search for an exciting and worthwhile Moonshot Project. I have been working tirelessly to find a new project that aligns with my interests and skills. I have been consulting with professors and other students, researching various areas of study, and attending lectures and workshops to broaden my knowledge and understanding of potential topics. I am confident that I will find a project that I am truly passionate about and that will allow me to make a meaningful contribution.<br><br>
In conclusion, while my initial Moonshot Project was not accepted, I have continued to persevere in my search for a suitable project. I am fully committed to finding a project that I am passionate about and that will challenge me to grow and develop my skills. While I may have to alter my original project idea, I am determined to find a topic that will allow me to apply my knowledge and creativity to make a valuable contribution. I am grateful for the experience of presenting my initial project and for the feedback that I received. I will use this feedback to improve and refine my approach as I continue on my journey to find the perfect Moonshot Project.
