## Definition
Augmented Reality (AR) technology has numerous benefits, including enhancing user experience, improving learning outcomes, and increasing engagement. AR technology is widely used in gaming, education, healthcare, and retail sectors. However, AR technology also poses challenges, such as high development costs and limited user base. In the future, AR technology is expected to integrate with artificial intelligence and wearable devices, making it more accessible and immersive for users.

## Devices
There are several devices that can be used to view Augmented Reality (AR), including:
- Smartphones: Most modern smartphones have AR capabilities built-in, and users can view AR content through their device's camera and screen.
- Tablets: Like smartphones, tablets also have AR capabilities and can display AR content on their screens.
- AR glasses: AR glasses, such as Microsoft HoloLens and Google Glass, are designed to provide an immersive AR experience by overlaying digital content onto the real world.
- Smartwatches: Some smartwatches have AR capabilities and can display AR content on their screens.
- Head-mounted displays (HMDs): HMDs, such as the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, are primarily used for virtual reality (VR) but can also display AR content.
