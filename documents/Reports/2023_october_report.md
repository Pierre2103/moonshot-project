## 1. Justification Behind Abandoning the Dronomatic Project

[Link to the Google Slides Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19H0K7SHy4pZ3hRw23gP3L9AiR9rzOizQ/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103335103381138944059&rtpof=true&sd=true)

I had a project idea about developing an application to control drones, particularly implementing the Points of Interest mode (POI) But DJI, a leading drone manufacturer, made this feature first[^1]. Furthermore, my personal interest in drones wasn't significant. As a result, I opted to pivot my project's direction.

## 2. Introduction to the Artwork Scanning Idea

The next idea I thought was developing an application to scan museum artworks. Users would obtain detailed information about the artwork, its history, and its artist. Additionally, I envisioned incorporating two educational games to enhance user engagement.

One game would be a quiz about the artworks and artists, and the other, a treasure hunt style game guiding users to find specific artworks in the museum they are visiting. However, during my mock-up stage[^2], I discovered Smartify[^3], an application very similar to my idea.
Knowing the established presence of Smartify, which works in partnership with over 700 companies in some thirty countries, I decided to pivot once again.

## 3. Introduction to the Book Scanning Concept

My latest project idea is similar to the artwork scanning concept but adapted for books. Users can scan a book cover to receive detailed information, such as its author, summary, price, publication date, genre, and more.

## 4. Justification for the Book Scanning Concept

To offer some context, seven years ago, I developed my first website, cataloging my comic book collection. At that time, I had to manually input each comic's details.
In 2023, I aim to create an app that can automatically fetch and display a book's details upon scanning. If a particular book is missing from the database, users have the option to add it.

Users can create a profile, mark their favorite books, maintain a reading list, and receive personalized recommendations based on their reading history.

## 5. Potential Challenges and Ambition

There exists an application offering similar features. It allows users to scan a book but only reads text from the cover without accessing a comprehensive database for detailed information[^4], but it's not there anymore[^5]. Furthermore, its main utility is tracking reading notes, and its premium features come at a cost. Despite the similarities, my envisioned application offers a richer experience.

To bring this project to life, several challenges must be addressed:

- Compiling a vast database of books and authors.
- Developing and refining deep learning models for book recognition.
- Ensuring user-friendly experiences on both Android and iOS.
- Building a companion website to manage the database and user profiles.
- Integrating with APIs to pull book details and facilitate purchases or borrowing.

Reaching these milestones is certainly ambitious, but it's a challenge I want to succeed in.
