## 1.1 - Purpose

<!-- The Moonshot Project is an academic project included in the curriculum of the Degree at ALGOSUP School. The purpose of the project is to build a full-stack project from the idea to the deployment. 

The project I will build is a platform available through an app or a website that allows the user to scan a book cover and get all the information about it. The project will include a lot of technologies such as Frontend, Backend, Database, Hosting, CI/CD, Machine Learning, OCR, and more. -->
